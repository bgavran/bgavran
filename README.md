### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm applying Category theory, the science of structure, to the field of deep learning, which aims to learn structure from data. 

My most recent project is a [framework for type-safe tensor processing which supports non-cubical tensors](https://github.com/bgavran/TypeSafe_Tensors)

My academic work can be found [here](https://www.brunogavranovic.com/papers.html).

### Hi there 👋

I'm applying Category theory, the science of structure, to the field of deep learning, which aims to learn structure from data. 

My most recent project is a [TensorType](https://github.com/bgavran/TypeSafe_Tensors): a framework for type-safe, pure functional and non-cubical tensor processing, written in Idris 2.

My academic work can be found [here](https://www.brunogavranovic.com/papers.html).

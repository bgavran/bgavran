### Hi there 👋

I'm building neural networks that generate provably correct code, and the software infrastructure for training them.

I work on three fronts:

1. **New architectures**: Understanding old, and designing new neural networks that natively consume and produce structured data
2. **Mathematical Foundations**: Building the mathematics necessary to state precisely what it means to generalise, especially on data structures recursive in nature
3. **Infrastructure**: Building the stack required to train such networks in dependently-typed languages, including automatic differentiation and tight elaborator integration

In all of these, I use category theory, the mathematics of structure and composition, as a central glue.
